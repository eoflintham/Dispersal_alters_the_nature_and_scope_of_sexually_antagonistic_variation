# Dispersal_alters_the_nature_and_scope_of_sexually_antagonistic_variation

This repository contains SLiM v3 (see https://messerlab.org/slim/code) to perform the individual-based simulations in "Dispersal alters the nature and scope of sexually antagonistic variation" (Accepted, The American Naturalist).

In brief, we investigate how dispersal patterns affect the maintenanceo of genetic variation when segregating alleles have opposing (antagonistic) fitness effects across the sexes. We show that dispersal modulates the conditions under which sexually antagonistic selection maintains genetic polymorphism, due the effects of inbreeding and sex-specific kin competition. Using simulations we further examine these effects in a finite-sized population, in order to consider the consequences of random genetic drift. 

This repository contains a single file *AmNatSimulationCode.slim* which runs the simulation and produces an output file containing summary statistics analysed in the paper.
